# BananaBread
Bot deathmatch in the browser used to kill time in free period.

The whole point of this project was to get a working and unblocked web client of Kripken's original BananaBread game. All credit goes to Kripken for making the web port of Cube2.

From the original README:

>A port of the Cube 2/Sauerbraten 3D game engine/first person shooter to the
>web, compiling C++ and OpenGL to JavaScript and WebGL using Emscripten.

>Cube 2 is a compact and efficient 3D game engine. By compiling it
>to JavaScript and WebGL you can run a complete first person
>shooter in your web browser, using only standard web APIs and
>without any plugins.

>See the **[FAQ](https://github.com/kripken/BananaBread/wiki/FAQ)**.
